# Code-First-Girls---Final-Project---POKEMON TOP TRUMPS

This is my final project for the Code First Girls 8 week Coding Kickstarter Course in Python. 

Written in Python (my first time using Python) 

And first time using GitHub - learning commit, merge, push, pull etc as I went along

Project Brief: Top Trumps

In this project you'll create a small game where players compare stats, similar to the Top Trumps card game. The basic flow of the games is:

1. You are given a random card with different stats
2. You select one of the card's stats
3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
4. The stats of the two cards are compared
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins
